# Java Object-Oriented Approach
---

## Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain objects' lifecycles (including creation, dereferencing by reassignment, and garbage collection)

## Define and use fields and methods, including instance, static and overloaded methods

## Initialize objects and their members using initialization statements and constructors

## Understand variable scopes, applying Encapsulation and make objects immutabe

## Create and use subclasses and superclasses, including abstract classes

## Utilize polymorphism to cast and call methods, differentiating object type versus reference type

## Create and use interfaces including functional interface, private, default methods

## Use local variable type inference, including as lambda parameters
